# Music-MIdi-Projects
Following https://github.com/silveirago, I have started creating my own projects
The idea behind this 1-4-5 generator was to combine music theory with my recently learned Arduino skills.
It has been said that 95% of pop music follows the 1-4-5 structure.
It should be easy to learn the chords in this structure for every starting note, but it aint for me.
This project allows you to play perfect 1-4-5 major chords, starting on every note.
You can control the 1 note by using the potenciometer.

BUGS: use the pot before starting play. It works better if you dont touch it while playing.
